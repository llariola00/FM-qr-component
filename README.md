## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS flexbox
-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap 5.3.0

### What I learned

This is my 2nd Frontend Mentor challenge. I finished this one in 1h 30min., quite fast compared to my 1st challenge which took me 8h. Well, to be fair, this one was easier than the first one, as it's supposed to be the first challenge which is a newbie should solve.

While I did finish this one faster, I did not learn a lot of new things compared to my 1st challenge, so there's that. I did however, learn quite a bit more about Bootstrap, like how to use margins and padding more effectively. Also, fixed-bottom class is better for the attribution text.
